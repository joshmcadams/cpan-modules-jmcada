Weather::NWS::NDFDgen and Weather::NWs::NDFDgenByDay

Just a basic install...

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

This installer will attempt to use the NWS web services at the end of each of
the module-specific test scripts.  If you have failures there, you might want
to check your internet connection, firewall, etc.
