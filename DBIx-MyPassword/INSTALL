Just a standard module install will get the job done. If you would like,
you can set the environment variables MP_DBUSER, MP_DBPASS, MP_DBDS, and
MP_DBOPTS to allow the test scripts to connect to a real database.

	MP_DBUSER -> A real database user name
	MP_DBPASS -> The database user's password
	MP_DBDS   -> A DBI data source, for instance "dbi:mysql:test"
	MP_DBOPTS -> Any DBI connection options, for instance "RaiseError => 1, PrintError => 1"

Environment variables are not, these are the commands to install:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
