### 2006-09-09 version 1.02 ### 

Included perlcritic tests, which caused me to need to fix quite a bit 
of my code.  Also, it seems that my cpants score is okay now.

### 2004-09-26 version 1.01 ###

General cleanup of distribution in order to raise kwalitee of the code.
For this version that includes: 

- has_changelog: you're looking at it
- has_meta_yml
- has_test_pod
- has_test_pod_coverage

But can't help:

- extracts_nicely: can't understand why this is a problem... I'm 
extracting into a subdirectory

- is_prereq: not much that I can do here
